  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm Cassandra Mzola, a passionate science engagement professional with a background in Environmental and Water Sciences, and a growing portfolio in data analytics, ESG, and sustainability innovation. My journey began at the University of the Western Cape, where I earned my BSc and led various student initiatives — from managing social media for the UWC Choir to supporting first-year students and organizing a major 4IR conference.

  <p>
    After graduating in 2021, I strengthened my skills through ISO 14001:2015 EMS, Google's Data Analytics Certificate, and virtual internships with KPMG and Accenture. I discovered the powerful intersection of tech and the environment, which led me to ESG certification and founding <strong>Earth Connect</strong> — a platform dedicated to sustainability education in plain language.

  <p>
    I’m currently a Science Engagement Intern at <strong>SARAO</strong> through the NYS Programme. Here, I developed an <strong>Online Interactive Platform</strong> bridging science and society, which I presented at two major science conferences. I’ve also pitched <strong>EcoAnalytics</strong> — a waste data platform — at both the JAMII Femmes Programme and BRICS Women’s Startup Contest.

  <p>
    I combine creativity, science communication, and analytical thinking to make sustainability understandable, actionable, and impactful.
